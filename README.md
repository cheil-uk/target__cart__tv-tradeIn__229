## Test

## Background:

Having caught up with legal, to be in with a chance of being allowed to run this promo, we will need to display an additional disclaimer in the basket when trade-up is added, to make sure customers understand they are not receiving any trade-in value for their TV.

The only way we will be able to achieve this is to use target, so below are the two new requirements for the basket:

## Trigger 1 - as already briefed:

Condition - No trade-up promo added to basket

Target action – Hide ‘Add trade-in’ component

## Trigger 2 – additional request:

Condition – trade-up added to basket

Target action – display the following message:

Please note: The discount you receive is an incentive to recycle and to purchase a new Samsung television; it is not a trade-in value for the recycled TV. Recycled TVs are non-returnable and have a zero value. If you return your purchased TV for a refund (for any reason) you will not receive any amount or value for your recycled TV.
